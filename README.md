# My Portfolio

## Description

This is my portfolio I have created to showcase my various projects. This project was mainly to consolidate and practice my knowledge of advanced CSS and responsive design. At the moment, all project links currently do not lead anywhere as the projects there are placeholders for now... I intend to update this portfolio as I complete projects!
